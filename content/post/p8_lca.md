You are given root of a binary tree T of n nodes. You are also given references of two nodes a & b. You need to find the lowest common ancestor of a and b. Least or lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes is defined as the lowest node in T that has the two nodes as descendants. For this problem, we allow a node to be an ancestor/descendant of itself.
