I'm obsessed with optimizing my commute time so hence why I started commuting full time on a motorcycle to avoid traffic and long unreliable train rides. But a motorcycle has man cons such as parking, putting on tons of safety gear and higher running costs. Being my apartment is only a few miles from the office I decided on making my own skateboard! There is tons of info scattered across the internet so I decided to build a site to aggretiate some of the info and document the process.
