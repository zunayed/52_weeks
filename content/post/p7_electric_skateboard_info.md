I'm obsessed with optimizing my commute time! It's why I started commuting full time on a motorcycle to avoid traffic and long unreliable train rides. But a motorcycle has many cons such as parking, parking tickets, putting on tons of safety gear and higher running costs. Being my apartment is only a few miles from the office I decided on making my own electric longboard! There is tons of info scattered across the internet so I decided to build a site to aggregate some of the info and document the process.
