## Who I am
My name is Zunayed Ali Morsalin and I'm an engineer that grew up in Brooklyn. This is a place that lets anyone who is inclined partake in my musings of human and machine language.
My interests are in backend  development, hardware prototyping and data analysis.

For fun I have been working on a robotic arm for the last 7 years. I'll finish it one day :(
