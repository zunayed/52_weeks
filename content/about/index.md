## Who I am
My name is Zunayed Ali and I grew up in Brooklyn. This is a place that lets anyone who is inclined partake in my musings of human and machine language.

## What I do
After graduating college with an electrical engineering degree, I started working at a Mechanical, Electrical & Plumbing firm. I designed electrical infrastructure for large skyscrapers, hospitals, schools, and data centers. During my time as an senior electrical engineer, I started automating CAD modeling and the calculations that I performed and soon started creating small programs. When my days involved more coding then electrical engineering I decided to switch paths

My interests have been in full stack web development, hardware prototyping and data analysis.

For fun I have been working on a robotic arm for the last 7 years. I'll finish it one day :(
